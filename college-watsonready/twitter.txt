 A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. #AmericanSpirit I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the #AmericanSpirit. #JointAddress We are one people, with one destiny.

We all bleed the same blood.

We all salute the same flag.

And we are all made by the same God. Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. #AmericanSpirit #JointAddress We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. #JointAddress #AmericanSpirit Ryan‚Äôs legacy is etched into eternity. #AmericanSpirit My budget will increase funding for our Veterans. Our Veterans have delivered for this nation. Now we MUST deliver for them. #JointAddress We must provide the men and women of the U.S. Military with the tools they need to prevent war and ‚Äì if they must ‚Äì TO FIGHT AND TO WIN. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. #JointAddress #AmericanSpirit EVERY American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling for an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth. RT @WhiteHouse: "Our citizens deserve this, and so much more - so why not join forces to finally get it done?" #JointAddress  The time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines! #JointAddress We must ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage. #JointAddress Obamacare is collapsing ‚Äì and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice, it is a necessity. #JointAddress I am calling on Congress to REPEAL &amp; REPLACE OBAMACARE with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs &amp; provide better care. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding that will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American! I believe in free trade, but it also must be FAIR TRADE. I'm not going to let our great companies and workers be taken advantage of anymore! My team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies &amp; provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the US &amp; much harder for them to leave! Solving these problems will require us to tap into the #AmericanSpirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our storied history. In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined. #JointAddress It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. #JointAddress As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. #JointAddress My Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. #JointAddress We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country &amp; poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become addicted. I have issued a new directive that American pipelines must be made with American steel. #JointAddress #AmericanSpirit RT @WhiteHouse: Fighting for American Workers #JointAddress #AmericanSpirit  Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American People. #JointAddress #AmericanSpirit America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly Make America Great Again! #JointAddress #AmericanSpirit RT @WhiteHouse: This is the #AmericanSpirit. #JointAddress  A surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the #AmericanSpirit I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. #JointAddress We are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. #JointAddress #JointSession #MAGA
